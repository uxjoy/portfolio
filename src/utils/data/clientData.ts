      "Working with Sohanur (Joy) has been an absolute pleasure. He was extremely communicative and has quick turnaround time. Worked very well with feedback and iteration. Joy exceeded our expectations, especially since our project is a very niche application for a startup. He worked on designs for two applications that both ended up intuitive and clean. In the future as our needs change, would love to work with him again.",
